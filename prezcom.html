    <p>In my role as the leader of the CommonWEALTH of Scholars at Virginia Tech, a prestigious honors organization, I have cultivated a range of competencies and experiences that are inherently valuable in the realm of machine learning. This position has enabled me to:

        Foster Academic Excellence: Guide and support some of the brightest undergraduate students in their academic pursuits, nurturing a deep understanding of complex subjects including artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm development.
        
        Leadership and Team Management: Lead a diverse group of high-achieving students, coordinating academic and leadership activities. I encourage and facilitate innovative thinking and problem-solving among members.
        
        Community Building and Inclusion: Create and maintain an inclusive and intellectually stimulating environment. This mirrors the collaborative nature of tech teams, where fostering a diverse and inclusive environment is key to driving innovation and success. I oversee the planning and execution of various programs and events, demonstrating strong organizational and project management skills.</p>
