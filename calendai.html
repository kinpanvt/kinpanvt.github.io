    <h1>Project Exploration: CalendAI</h1>
    <h2>Role: Principal Developer</h2>
    
    <p>
      While pursuing a Computer Science degree with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), I spearheaded CalendAI, an innovative initiative under the mentorship of Dr. Andrew Kulak. Created to transform productivity through intelligent scheduling, CalendAI initially targeted students but quickly revealed broad applicability extending into professional environments and everyday productivity scenarios.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why CalendAI Matters: Filling a Crucial Productivity Gap</h3>
    <p>
      Modern life—academic or professional—is defined by countless responsibilities, competing priorities, and a constant struggle for effective time management. Traditional calendar apps lack intelligence, adaptability, and seamless integration, creating significant productivity hurdles:
      <img src="images/calendai_schedule.png" alt="CalendAI Schedule Example">
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inefficient Scheduling:</strong> Users waste valuable time manually adjusting events and managing competing priorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Integration:</strong> Fragmented workflows due to calendars that cannot seamlessly connect to professional or academic platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>No Intelligent Adaptation:</strong> Standard tools fail to learn from user behaviors, missing opportunities for proactive, adaptive scheduling.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> Users become overwhelmed by irrelevant reminders rather than actionable, prioritized tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CalendAI directly addresses these universal challenges, creating an intuitive, personalized, and intelligent productivity solution suitable for diverse users.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Beyond Academia: CalendAI’s Multimodal Potential</h3>
