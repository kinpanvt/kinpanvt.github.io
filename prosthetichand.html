    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      In a significant step forward in prosthetic technology, a team led by an ML Algorithm Specialist embarked on the Prosthetic Hand project, aiming to design and construct a functional prototype enhanced by machine learning. The project unfolded through several key stages:
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Design and Conceptualization</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      The project began with the conceptualization of a prosthetic hand capable of basic movements, like grasping. Using servos, Arduinos, and resources from the Frith lab, the team built an initial cardboard model that simulated finger mechanics.

    <h3>Integration of Machine Learning</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      Machine learning algorithms were incorporated to analyze hand movement patterns. Sensor data from a glove was used to train a model to replicate natural hand motions, improving grasping capabilities.

    <h3>CAD Modeling and Material Exploration</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      The design transitioned into a CAD model using Solidworks, exploring various manufacturing methods—including CNC machining—to create realistic components.
    </p>

    <h3>3D Printing and Resin Molding</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      3D printing and resin molding techniques were used to produce the palm and joint components, enhancing both the aesthetic and functional aspects.

    <h3>Final Modifications and Control Mechanism</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      In the final prototype, the Arduino was replaced with a DC power supply for improved control, and finger joints were directly attached to servos with regulation via potentiometers.

    <h3>Machine Learning Implementation for Adaptive Control</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      Integrating machine learning into the control system allowed the hand to adapt to different shapes and sizes, enhancing functionality through adaptive grasping techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="prosthetic-text">
      The Prosthetic Hand project bridged mechanical design and advanced technology, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven adaptive solutions in prosthetics.
