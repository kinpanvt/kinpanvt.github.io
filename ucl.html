    <p>In my position as an Upper Class Leader with the Galipatia Living Learning Community, I have spearheaded various projects and initiatives that resonate with the core competencies of machine learning engineering. My role encompasses:

        Leadership and Project Management: Managed and led diverse community initiatives, including organizing design competitions and machine learning projects for freshmen. I actively participated in and hosted community events, promoting an inclusive and dynamic environment. 
        
        Web and Social Media Management: Handled the efficient communication of news and resources through the management of the community's website and social media. This responsibility demonstrates my capability in digital content management and information dissemination, skills pertinent to understanding user interactions in e-commerce platforms.
        
        Innovative Technological Solutions: Played a pivotal role in the development of a smart calendar app that leverages machine learning to provide intelligent recommendations. This project, undertaken alongside upperclassmen and professors like Dr. Andrew Kulak, showcases my direct involvement with machine learning applications. It reflects my understanding of how machine learning can be utilized to enhance user experience and decision-making processes, a key element in e-commerce search technologies.</p>
