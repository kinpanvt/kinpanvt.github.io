    <p>As a Summer Start Peer Mentor, my role involved guiding first-year students through the complexities of college life, an experience that honed a variety of skills. My responsibilities included:
        Leadership and Collaboration: I actively led and mentored new students, enhancing my leadership skills, while simultaneously working closely with faculty and staff to provide comprehensive academic and social support. This dual role allowed me to develop a holistic approach to student guidance, fostering both individual growth and strong collaborative relationships with educational professionals.
        
        Community Building: Organized events and activities that cultivated a sense of community and belonging among students. Building such a cohesive community mirrors the importance of fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment in tech teams, especially in projects that require diverse perspectives and teamwork.
        
        Observing Growth and Transformation: Witnessing the growth of mentees provided insights into the dynamics of learning and development. This understanding is beneficial  considering user behavior and needs.</p>
